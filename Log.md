# 100 Days Of ML Code - LOG

### Day 0 : 15 Jul , 2018

**Today's Progress :** 

- installed OpenPose and set up other IDE 
- started a new loop for the summer project

**Thoughts :** Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

**Links :**  OpenPose

- [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) github rep

### Day 1 : 16 Jul , 2018

**Today's Progress :** 

- Started the framework of the application; - Emm, not really
- learnt some code examples from other projects.

**Thoughts :** Started the first line code of ML, thanks for the inspiration of the great music from [*Rainbow Kitten Surprise*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMINv5ggLww).

### Day 2 : 17 Jul , 2018

**Today's Progress :** 

- search many pose cases; 
- list all the tools needed later; 
- install TensorFlow and try it easily;

**Thoughts :** it's a little bit difficult for me to use TF directly, still need to learn the basic concepts of CNN again.

### Day 3 : 18 Jul , 2018

**Today's Progress :** 

- finished the prototypes of the Yoga-Pose project
- searched some materials and known that I need learn **JavaScript** and **Python** and the basic logic of **Deep Learning** and how to use **TensorFlow**

**Thoughts :** Even though make sure that I could use those fancy open-source tools to build my own application, I still know nothing about this area. Every challenging thing the smart people have done, so all I received is just the empty happiness of the mechanical engineering. So, still need to learn the basic concepts of everything! Go on.

### Day 4: 19 Jul, 2018

**Today's Progress :** 

- installed Visual Studio Code
- learnt JavaScript basic part: [high-order function](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/001434446689867b27157e896e74d51a89c25cc8b43bdb3000/0014351219769203e3fbe1ed611475db3d439393add8997000) 
- wrote some JS learning notes

**Thoughts :** implement this application firstly, then consider the deeper problem of building or improving model.
